If any other policies on a declaration basis cover the stocks hereby insured the declarations shall be made so as to apportion to each policy a share of the value of the stocks insured under such declaration policies, pro rata to the respective amount named in the policies. In the event of declaration not being made within the thirty days mentioned above then the insured shall be deemed to have declared the sum insured hereby as the value at risk. On the expiry of each period of insurance the premium shall be calculated at the agreed rate of as stated in the specification on the average sum insured, namely, the total of the values declared or deemed to have been declared divided by the number of declarations due to have been made. If the resultant premium be greater than the provisional premium the insured shall pay the difference, if it be less, the difference shall be repaid to the insured but such repayment shall not exceed 20% of the provisional premium. 2. The basis of value for declaration shall be market value and any loss hereunder shall be settled on the basis of the market value immediately anterior to the loss. 3.

If after the occurrence of a loss it is found that the amount of the last declaration previous to the loss is less than the amount that ought to have been declared, then the amount which would have been recoverable by the insured shall be reduced in such proportion as the amount of the said last declaration bears to the amount that ought to have been declared. 5. Notwithstanding the occurrence of a loss it is understood that the sum insured will be maintained at all time during the currency of the policy and the Insured therefore undertakes to pay extra premium on the amount of any loss pro rata from the date such loss to the expiry of the period of insurance, the premium, being calculated at the rate applicable to the stocks destroyed and such extra premium shall not be taken into account in, and shall be distinct from the final adjustment of premium. 6. In the event of this policy being cancelled by the Insured during its currency (whether stocks exist or not) the premium to be retained by the Company shall be the appropriate short period premium calculated on the average amount insured up to the date of cancelment or 80% of the provisional premium whichever is the greater: but if the policy is cancelled by the insured after a loss has occurred the premium to be retained by the Company shall be the pro rata proportion of the premium calculated on the average amount insured up to the date of cancelment plus the pro rata proportion of the premium from the date of loss to the expiry of the period of insurance on the amount of the loss paid, or 80% of the provisional premium whichever is the greater. 7. The maximum liability of the Company shall not exceed the sum insured hereby and premium shall not be receivable on values in excess thereof.
