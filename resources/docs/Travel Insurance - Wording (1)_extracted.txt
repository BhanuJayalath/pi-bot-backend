If after twelve months have elapsed after the date of the Accident, it still cannot be established, the Insured may ask The Assistance Company for a new deadline of up to twelve months more, after which the latter will have to establish the disablement on the basis of which it considers will be the final outcome.

EXCLUSIONS TO SECTION (4): The Insurer and /or The Assistance Company shall not be liable for Claims resulting from: a) Travel by aircrafts or any other Common Carriers whether licensed to carry passengers against fare or not. b) Armed conflicts (having existed or not official declaration of war). c) The use of helicopters and means of aerial navigation not authorized for the public transporting of passengers. d) Active participation in criminal acts or in bets, challenges or arguments except in the case of legitimate self-defense or state of need. e) Participations in any organized dangerous competition, races, sports and training thereon. f) Suicide or attempting suicide or any willful Injury.
