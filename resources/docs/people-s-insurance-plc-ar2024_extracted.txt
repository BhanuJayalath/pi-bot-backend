People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 12 Commitment to Sustainable Business Sustainability remains at the heart of PI’s core business as a general insurer, where disciplined underwriting, investments, and operational practices aim to safeguard the continuity of operations and ensure the business model remains resilient, and forward-looking. Recognising that its role to sustainability extends beyond these conventional practices, the Company has in recent years begun actively working towards environmental protection, social well-being and ethical governance. A critical aspect of PI’s sustainability approach is its commitment to mitigating climate risks and reducing its environmental footprint. Internally, efforts to enhance its operational efficiency have been significantly enhanced by prioritising responsible consumption of resources, including by adopting energy-efficient practices in its offices. On the social front, the Company leverages digital innovation to expand financial protection to those previously excluded from traditional insurance models. By utilising mobile and online platforms, PI enhances accessibility, allowing customers, particularly in rural and remote areas to purchase policies, submit claims, and access support services seamlessly. Employee well-being and diversity are also central to PI’s social commitment, with policies that promote equal opportunity, skills development, and a workplace culture rooted in inclusivity. The Company also engages in impactful corporate social responsibility initiatives, supporting disaster relief efforts, road safety awareness programs, and financial literacy campaigns. From a governance perspective, the Company focuses on ethics through a zero- tolerance of unethical practices, supported by a Code of Conduct and whistleblower mechanisms. Data security is another key priority. Additionally, PI maintains a comprehensive risk management framework, overseen by the Board, ensuring effective internal controls, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance to support long-term sustainability.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 26 A Message from the Board of Directors The Board of Directors of People’s Insurance PLC takes great pleasure in presenting the Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Company for the year ending 31 December 2024. Throughout this past year, the Board continued to review and refine the Company’s strategic initiatives in response to evolving market dynamics and regulatory changes. The Board also provided strategic guidance on investment decisions, capital allocation, and cost management to drive profitability and enhance shareholder returns. Risk management remained a critical priority, with the Board overseeing the implementation of robust risk mitigation strategies in light of macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory developments, and emerging industry risks. PI’s governance framework was further strengthened in the year under review against the backdrop of the latest regulatory developments. We wish to take this opportunity to highlight the key governance initiatives undertaken by the Board during the year, to ensure our governance model remains agile, responsive, and aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives. Governance Update for FY 2024 Influenced by a series of significant regulatory changes that reshaped the corporate governance landscape, compliance took centre stage in the Board’s agenda in 2024. A key development was the introduction of Section 9 of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Listing Rules on Corporate Governance, which enumerated Board independence, strengthened the functioning of Board Sub-Committees, and mandated a more disciplined approach to shareholder relations and corporate disclosures. Additionally, the new governance requirements also emphasised the need for a structured approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. Keen to adhere to all compliance deadlines, the Board revisited the Company’s existing policies, procedures and structures, with necessary changes instituted to meet compliance deadlines. Further, in light of the new directive and circulars issued by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL), the Board, with the support of Sub Committees, moved swiftly to strengthen internal operational controls and monitoring mechanisms to achieve full adherence with these mandates.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 27 Another major priority for the Board was ensuring full readiness for SLFRS 17, a landmark financial reporting standard that fundamentally changes the way insurance contracts are recognised, measured, and disclosed. Throughout the year, PI undertook a comprehensive transition strategy, which included upgrading financial reporting systems, enhancing actuarial modelling capabilities, and conducting rigorous staff training programs. A dedicated project team was established to oversee compliance, ensuring that PI met all reporting requirements seamlessly. In parallel, PI commenced preparations for the adoption of SLFRS S1 and S2, the new sustainability reporting standards that will set a global benchmark for corporate disclosures on sustainability risks and climate- related financial information. The Board led efforts to develop internal sustainability reporting frameworks, integrate ESG metrics into financial reporting, and enhance data collection and verification mechanisms. PI also engaged with external consultants to align its reporting practices with international best practices, reinforcing the Company’s commitment to transparency and sustainable value creation.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 28 Chairperson’s Message It was a remarkable year of growth and progress for People’s Insurance PLC. Led by a firm conviction to position the Company among top non-life insurers in Sri Lanka, the Board prioritised sustainable top-line growth, profitability, and capital adequacy, to further reinforce financial stability. I can confidently say, the strategic direction by the Board has been instrumental in achieving these objectives. For instance, the decision to restructure our sales channels and expand our talent pool which has imbibed a more disciplined and results-driven approach across the organisation, culminated in a 8.4% increase in PI’s Gross Written Premium (GWP) from 2023 to 2024. Backed by key strategic initiatives to enhance financial resilience, our solvency position also strengthened significantly, with Total Available Capital (TAC) rising to Rs. 5,183 Mn as at 31 December 2024, up by Rs. 487 Mn from Rs. 4,696 Mn in the previous year. Similarly, the Company’s Risk-based Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) reported a 53% fold increase from 336% in 2023 to an impressive 389% in 2024, far exceeding the regulatory minimum of 120%. Our asset base too has grown substantially, reaching Rs. 12,689 Mn by end December 2024, a testament to prudent asset management and our success in attracting and retaining customers. Governance and Compliance The past year has been one of significant regulatory advancements and strategic realignments for PI. A key development was the introduction of Section 9 of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Listing Rules on Corporate Governance. Taking cognisance of the new changes, the PI Board promptly revisited existing policies and structures to ensure full compliance with these new governance mandates, specifically to strengthen Board independence, enhance the effectiveness of Board Sub-Committees, and reinforced transparency in shareholder relations and corporate disclosures. Moreover, in alignment with directives from the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL), we also took decisive to strengthen internal controls and monitoring mechanisms, ensuring full adherence to regulatory requirements. Another major priority was improving our readiness for SLFRS 17, a transformative financial reporting standard that redefines the basis of recognition, measurement, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Considering the complexity of the work involved, a dedicated project team was deployed to oversee the implementation of a comprehensive transition strategy, including the revamp of the financial system and significant enhancements to the actuarial modelling structure coupled with extensive training and gap bridging for the Company’s internal teams. Simultaneously, we also began preparations for SLFRS S1 and S2, the latest sustainability reporting standards set to come into effect from the next financial year. The Board spearheaded efforts to integrate the relevant metrics into financial reporting, enhance data collection frameworks, and align PI’s sustainability disclosures with these best practices. Appreciations As I bid farewell, I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the Board, corporate management and staff for their unwavering commitment to the Company’s vision. Looking ahead, I am confident that the solid foundation we have built will propel PI to secure a place among Sri Lanka’s top non-life insurers. I look forward to witnessing this vision come to life in the years ahead and take great pride in having contributed to this journey over the past 5 years. In conclusion, I extend my best wishes to the Board, the management team, and the entire PI family as they forge ahead in shaping a future of success, stability, and long-term value for all stakeholders of the Company. Isuru Balapatabendi Chairman (Resigned with effective from 18 November 2024) As I bid farewell, I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the Board, corporate management and staff for their unwavering commitment to the Company’s vision.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 29 Reflections from Our Chief Executive Officer As I reflect on 2024, I readily acknowledge that People’s Insurance PLC has not just navigated a rapidly evolving operating environment but has done so with great success to emerge stronger and more resilient. In an industry marked by intense competition, regulatory shifts, and economic fluctuations, we have remained steadfast in delivering value to our stakeholders. Moreover, our unwavering commitment to excellence, strategic agility, and customer-centric approach have positioned us as one of the most profitable general insurance providers in Sri Lanka. Let me take this opportunity to outline the key aspects of our journey over the past year, the challenges and opportunities we encountered, and recap our performance for FY 2024. The Sri Lankan Economy Regains Momentum The Sri Lankan economy in 2024 demonstrated encouraging signs of recovery, marking a shift from the turbulence of previous years. With key sectors such as agriculture, construction, services, and tourism driving economic momentum, GDP growth for 2024 projected to have touched 5%. Inflation remained within a manageable range of 4%–6%, while prudent monetary policies by the Central Bank helped stabilise interest rates. The Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated by 10.7% against the US dollar. Collectively signalling the long awaited economic correction. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

A Resilient Performance by the Local General Insurance Industry Against this backdrop of economic resurgence in 2024, Sri Lanka’s general insurance industry demonstrated resilience to record 6.9% increase in Gross Written Premiums (GWP). The non-motor segment saw strong expansion, with medical insurance emerging as the top performer, recording an impressive 17% growth, driven by increased consumer awareness and Sri Lanka’s ageing population. Fire and marine insurance also maintained steady momentum, growing at 6% and 5%, respectively. The motor segment recorded the lowest growth. Yet again stymied by stagnation in the vehicle market resulting from the import restrictions that have been in place since 2020, the motor insurance segment grew by a mere 8%. Nevertheless, given its historical dominance, the motor segment accounted for more than 54% overall GWP mix. Claims trends reflected the spillover effects of the 2022 economic crisis and its related developments. Higher claims, particularly in the health segments, were attributed to the rise in medical expenses driven by inflationary conditions in the recent past. Similarly, the rise in motor claims was due to the combined impact of inflationary pressures and the exchange rate volatility in 2023. While higher claims brought pressure on underwriting profits of non-life insurers, the situation was further exacerbated owing to the government- mandated 100% cession of Strike Riot Civil Commotion & Terrorism premiums to the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF). As a result, underwriting profits reported by the general insurance industry declined compared to 2023. A Clear and Balanced Business Strategy The economic recovery presented both opportunities and challenges for PI. One of the key challenges we faced was the price wars among competitors, making it difficult to maintain a profitable pricing strategy which led to margin erosion. For our part, we decided to adopt a risk-based pricing model. We continued to remain flexible and adapted our underwriting approach to account for externalities. Our focus on data-driven decision-making proved to be a significant advantage in improving pricing accuracy and risk assessment. Meanwhile, rather than competing solely on pricing, we opted to differentiate ourselves against peers by focusing on superior customer service, innovative products, and a streamlining claims settlement process. We continued to invest in digital platforms to enhance service delivery and improve the accuracy, transparency, and efficiency of our claims processes. Significant upgrades were made to the assessor application, improving efficiency and service quality in claim settlements alongside the introduction of a mechanism to facilitate claim payouts to be made directly to customers’ bank accounts. A new online onboarding process was rolled out greatly simplifying the process of obtaining a motor insurance third party policy online. We also expanded and upskilled our sales staff to provide door-to-door service, enabling a more personalised approach and greater convenience for policyholders. I am convinced that the strong focus on customer experience has gone a long way in building trust with existing clients while supporting new customer acquisition strategies. I am happy to see the economic turnaround creating some robust growth opportunities. For instance, the revival in tourism created a surge in demand for insurance products, particularly travel and motor insurance, as well as personal accident covers for inbound tourists. Recognising this opportunity, we tailored our offerings to the tourism sector and forged partnerships with travel agencies and hospitality providers to grow PI’s bandwidth across the tourism vertical. In parallel, we amplified our market penetration strategies in other segments as well. Forming partnerships with several leading financial institutions we focused on expanding our distribution network to leverage People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 30 In 2024, we made strong strides in the sustainability sphere through conscious efforts to reduce waste, improve resource efficiency, and embed environmental responsibility across our operations.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 31 cross-selling of insurance products as a strategy to make inroads into high growth potential markets. At the same time, targeted localised strategies in these markets were aimed at ensuring that our products met the specific needs of each region. Inspired by the success of these initial attempts, we worked to further strengthen our partner networks aiming to grow our market presence across Sri Lanka. Financial Highlights for FY 2024 PI recorded GWP growth of 8.4% year- on-year, which while falling short of our ambitious 22% target, was nevertheless ahead of the market average. Several factors influenced the Company’s profitability during the year. The cascading effect of inflationary conditions and the depreciation of the LKR in 2023 led to increased claim payouts across both medical and motor segments in 2024. The 17% decline in investment income, driven by the low-interest rate environment was another key concern. With the prevailing low interest rate environment adversely affecting income from our investment portfolio, we resorted to greater portfolio diversification. Well-timed strategies were instrumental in offsetting the low returns from traditional fixed-income investments. The 10% rise in operating expenses attributed to higher staff costs, technology investments, and branch network expansion, added pressure on the bottom line. However, the most significant adverse impact on the current year bottom line was due to the mandatory 100% cession of Strike Riot Civil Commotion & Terrorism premiums to the NITF. Despite these challenges, the relentless focus on optimising operational efficiency and stringent cost management enabled PI to achieve a PBT of Rs. 701.6 Mn for FY 2024, which I am proud to say has cemented our position as the most profitable listed general insurer in Sri Lanka for the year. I am very pleased to announce that PI’s capital position strengthened significantly in the year 2024. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) rose to 389%, up from 336% in the previous year, reflecting prudent liquidity management and disciplined investment strategies. On that note, I wish to confirm that we have made excellent progress on the adoption of the SLFRS 17 standards with ongoing efforts to assess the impact on existing Company practices and determine the optimal transition approach. With implementation well underway we are confident of full compliance by the 01 January 2026 deadline. People Development Regrettably, we continued to witness the lingering effects of the 2022 economic downturn affecting our ability to attract and retain young talent, as the overseas migration trend continued well into year 2024. To address this, we worked on enhancing our employee value proposition by strengthening compensation packages and revamping our approach to career development with the introduction of a robust succession planning structure mapped against PI’s medium term growth trajectory. We also rolled out several targeted employee engagement initiatives to enhance workplace satisfaction and promote employee wellbeing. Additionally, we forged a series of partnerships with universities and training institutions to bolster our chances to access top talent to support our future workforce needs. Sustainability Stewardship In 2024, we made strong strides in the sustainability sphere through conscious efforts to reduce waste, improve resource efficiency, and embed environmental responsibility across our operations. On the waste reduction front, we focused mainly on tackling paper waste. We extracted over 1,700 boxes of archived documents to create a stock of one-side printed A4 sheets for internal use over the next two years. Further, following a deep dive into our existing inventory it was found that purchase of external correspondence sheets will not be required for the next three years.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 32 Reflections from Our Chief Executive Officer Reinforcing our commitment to reduce single-use plastic waste, we replaced plastic water bottles and cups with glass bottles and reusable cups. In parallel, a structured monitoring and reporting mechanism was established to track and reduce food and polythene waste, with separate collection bins introduced to promote proper waste segregation. We also started sharing waste tracking metrics with staff to promote awareness and accountability. As part of our overall approach to reducing waste, we also encouraged recycling and reuse. Creative competitions were launched to inspire employees to repurpose materials for seasonal decorations. We also initiated a Company-wide carbon footprint calculation project, with the first phase focused on measuring Scope 1 and Scope 2, while the second phase of the project will aim to integrate Scope 3 emissions reporting for better monitoring and quantifiable disclosures. In the third phase we are targeting to obtain independent assurance for PI’s emission profile in line with global standards. Awards and Accolades It was another rewarding year for PI as we added to our growing list of awards and accolades from both local and global awarding bodies. Our achievements at the Global Banking and Finance Awards 2024 include the highly-coveted Non-Life Insurance Brand of the Year – Sri Lanka and also claimed the award for Best Auto Insurance Process (Call & Go) – Sri Lanka, which I must reiterate stands as a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation in customer service. Further solidifying our position as a market leader in the industry, PI was declared the Non-Life Insurer of the Year – Sri Lanka at the Global Economics Awards 2024. At the Iconic Awards Sri Lanka, PI’s dedication to delivering exceptional customer service earned us the prestigious Best Customer Service in General Insurance – People’s Excellency Award 2024. Our commitment to accountability and reporting transparency was recognised at multiple forums. PI’s Integrated Annual Report for 2023 secured Gold in the Insurance Sector (Gross Premium up to Rs. 10 Bn) at the TAGS Awards 2024, organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, and also received a Merit Award at the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2024, presented by CMA Sri Lanka. PI’s dedication to building strong corporate relationships was acknowledged by SLIM, where we were recognised as one of the Best Corporate Clients. Looking Ahead: 2025 and Beyond As Sri Lanka moves toward economic stability, I anticipate a more predictable regulatory environment, improved investor confidence, and a gradual normalisation of the insurance sector which will create a strong foundation for PI to accelerate its growth trajectory. We will continue to focus on expanding our business by targeting high- revenue growth sectors such as SMEs, construction, solar energy, and tourism. Even as we accelerate our market reach, strong underwriting discipline will be crucial to achieving long- term profitability. Our goal will be to implement more stringent underwriting frameworks to reduce loss ratios and ensure that risk assessments align with our financial objectives. A key target for 2025 is to achieve underwriting profitability by guiding our sales teams to focus on profitable classes of business in line with the objectives set by our Board and Parent Company. To that end, expanding the non-motor segment through our regional sales force will be a key priority, underscored by a cost break-even strategy for the national sales channel. Equally importantly we will seek to strengthen corporate client engagement through customised insurance solutions that will help us secure long-term partnerships and increase market share. I also see immense potential in strategic partnerships as a key lever to drive market penetration and market development as well as target more profitable segments. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Board of Directors for their outstanding leadership, which has enabled People’s Insurance PLC to strengthen its market position despite countless challenges in the 2024 financial year.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 33 Technology adoption will be at the heart of PI’s strategy for improving customer experience and operational efficiency.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 42 Materiality In 2024, PI further strengthened its materiality determination process by adopting the double materiality assessment methodology, to evaluate material topics via two key dimensions: impact materiality and financial materiality. The impact materiality aims to determine the Company’s impact on environmental and social factors, while the financial materiality evaluates how sustainability-related risks and opportunities associated with each material topic could potentially affect the Company’s financial performance. By integrating both perspectives, PI aims to enhance transparency, align with evolving regulatory requirements, and strengthen its long-term sustainability strategy. Value chain mapping and establishing a longlist of ESG topics considering PI’s strategy, business model, risk and governance processes as well as influences from the broader operating environment and insights from the stakeholder engagement process Prioritise topics based on likelihood of occurrence vs. intensity of impact Ongoing review to assess the validity of material topics Use the Double Materiality methodology to identify impacts, financial risks, and opportunities Results are presented to the Board for approval followed by integration into the Company’s strategic planning process 3, 6, 7, 12 8, 13, 14, 15 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 Intensity of Impact Likelihood of Occurrence The determination of PI’s Material Matters is an iterative process, wherein the Corporate Management actively engages in identifying challenges and opportunities arising from the internal and external environments that could materially impact the Company’s operations.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 56 Operating Environment GLOBAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE Overall, the global economy in 2024 showed moderate growth but marred by regional disparities. While advanced economies displayed resilience, emerging markets faced challenges that tempered their recovery. According to the Global Economic Prospects (GEP) January 2025 report, global GDP growth in 2024 was projected to be 3.2%. Inflation, which had been a major global concern in recent years, showed signs of moderation in 2024. The slowdown in inflation was attributed to the effectiveness of tight monetary policies and a reduction in supply chain bottlenecks. Global trade continued to expand, although at a slower pace than in previous years. The growth in international trade was dampened by weaker demand, especially in advanced economies, although trade volumes in developing markets showed some recovery, driven by robust demand for goods in the Asia-Pacific region. The global investment outlook remained cautious in 2024, impacted by uncertainty owing to geopolitical tensions, in particular the continuity of the Russia/Ukraine war nearing its fourth year and the Israel/Palestine conflict entering its second year. 0 1 2 3 4 Contributions to Global Growth % Points % 2024e 2025f 2026f 0 1 2 3 4 2010-19 average United States Other EMDEs Euro area China Other AEs World (RHS) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Global Trade Growth % 2024e 2025f 2026f Global trade growth 2010-19 average 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Headline Consumer Price Inﬂation % World Advanced economies EMDEs Nov-19 Mar-20 Jul-20 Nov-20 Mar-21 Jul-21 Nov-21 Mar-22 Jul-22 Nov-22 Mar-23 Jul-23 Nov-23 Mar-24 Jul-24 Nov-24 Sri Lankan Economy In 2024, Sri Lanka’s economy showed signs of recovery after the economic crisis of 2022, with several key indicators pointing towards gradual stabilisation and growth. The country’s GDP growth was projected at around 4.5% to 5% for the year with several sectors contributing to this positive growth. Agriculture saw a moderate recovery, aided by improved weather conditions and government support. The construction and services sectors benefited from increased domestic and international demand. Tourism, which had been severely impacted by the pandemic, showed a strong recovery, supported by increased tourist arrivals. Inflation and Interest Rates Inflation in Sri Lanka remained under control in 2024, and within the targeted 4% - 6% band throughout the year. Meanwhile conscious efforts by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) helped to stabilise interest rates, which had been highly volatile in previous years, leading to notable credit growth in the private sector from May 2024 onwards, which further solidified economic recovery. Exchange Rate The Sri Lankan rupee outperformed several major currencies over the course of 2024, appreciating by around 10.7% against the US Dollar, driven by a combination of factors such as a surge in foreign currency inflows from tourism, worker remittances, and export earnings. Despite some volatility toward the end of the year, the rupee’s overall performance marked a significant recovery from the previous years’ sharp depreciation, making it one of the best-performing currencies among emerging markets. IMF Programme Sri Lanka’s participation in the IMF programme continued to be a key aspect of its stabilisation efforts, although In 2024, Sri Lanka’s economy showed signs of recovery after the economic crisis of 2022, with several key indicators pointing towards gradual stabilisation and growth.

On the other hand, within the non- motor segment, medical insurance showed strong growth, benefiting from increasing awareness and the growing need for healthcare coverage. Achieving 17% growth year on year, medical insurance became the top performer within general insurance.

These missed targets raised concerns among international observers, although the IMF maintained its support for Sri Lanka’s long-term economic recovery.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 58 Operating Environment Claims Claims trends in 2024 exhibited some upward pressure owing to external factors. While the industry saw a general decline in claims during the early months, reflecting improved underwriting and risk management practices, claims from motor accidents and property damages were higher in certain areas, partly due to inflationary factors and the economic recovery post-pandemic. Furthermore, health insurance claims also increased, with more people seeking coverage due to rising medical costs. The increase in claims in health and motor segments, contributed to higher claim ratios across the industry. However, the overall claims ratio was managed effectively by insurers through better cost controls and efficient claims processing. 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Gross Premiums for Diﬀerent Classes of Insurance Rs.

The move, part of the effort to boost government revenue, had a significant impact on the profitability of general insurers.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 59 The General insurance industry is characterized by a stiff competition with over 13 insurance companies competing in the Insurance market, including state sector and international players. Further, key talent poaching by the competitors also can be considered as a main threat influencing the industry. Competitive Rivalry Threat of New Entrants Bargaining power of customers Bargaining power of suppliers Threat of Substitutes Insurance industry in Sri Lanka is highly regulated and given a large number of players currently operating in the local insurance market, new entrants will find it challenging to create the necessary brand visibility needed to sustain their operations. However, new players targeting market gaps such as the technology-driven space have credible opportunities for entry. Low switching costs give customers high bargaining power. This has influenced customers to demand tailor-made solutions. Given the large number of insurance agents and insurance brokers, their bargaining power is relatively low. However, reinsurance partners hold significant power, considering their global reputation and long standing credibility. Conventional insurance products are well defined and hence there is very little risk of substitutes. However, of late, tech-driven product innovation has been responsible for transforming the mainstream insurance product lines. Assessment of the General Insurance Industry Using Poter’s Five Forces Low Medium High Our response Focus on adjusting pricing, marketing and service strategies adopted by the Company to drive differentiation and enhance brand positioning.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 61 Future Outlook Sri Lanka is expected to experience a gradual economic recovery from 2025, with GDP growth for the next few years projected between 4% and 5% annually, driven by private sector investment, structural reforms, and sustained performances in sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Inflation is anticipated to ease as macroeconomic conditions stabilise aided by the tight monetary policies stance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. As inflation moderates, purchasing power is set to improve, in turn boosting consumer spending, including demand for insurance products. The stability of the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) will be crucial for economic and industry stability. A stable exchange rate would help control inflation, attract foreign investment, and stabilize insurance pricing models. External trade and investment are both expected to improve as Sri Lanka’s economic health strengthens. Foreign direct investment (FDI) will also likely to grow significantly in the coming years. Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, political stability, and ongoing reforms provide a positive outlook for the general insurance industry from 2025 onwards. However, challenges will persist requiring proactive action by general insurers to remain competitive. Similarly, some very viable opportunities are likely to position the industry for sustained growth. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 64 Financial Capital Analysis of Financial Performance During the financial year, the Company maintained strong financial health amidst the challenging economic conditions. Effective cost management, improved underwriting, and solid capital buffers ensured profitability and stability despite inflation and interest rate fluctuations. Gross Written Premium (GWP) The 8% GWP growth of People’s Insurance PLC in 2024 attributed to several factors. The economic stabilization efforts in Sri Lanka, including improved reserves and controlled inflation, positively impacted consumer spending and business confidence. The Company’s focus on customer-centric solutions, innovative product offerings, and digital enhancements contributed to this growth. Amidst rising awareness of insurance protection, PI successfully leveraged its brand strength and distribution network to expand its reach. Operational efficiencies and prudent underwriting practices further reinforced profitability and sustainable growth in a competitive landscape. 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 Gross Written Premium Rs.

The fire segment demonstrated strong growth, recording a 15% increase and contributing 11% to the overall GWP, reflecting heightened demand for property insurance solutions.

In 2024, the Company reduced its reinsurance premiums by 39%, as a result of reversal of provision made with regards to motor SRCC & TC 100% cession in 2023. This reduction was further driven by improved underwriting practices, a favourable claims environment, and a stable market outlook. While the Company’s cession ratio has been around 20%, this approach enhances cost efficiency and supports long-term profitability. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 10 15 20 25 30 35 Premium Ceded to Reinsurers Rs.

During the year, the Company’s underwriting and net acquisition costs increased by 89% to Rs. 491 Mn, reflecting strategic investments in expanding distribution channels and strengthening market presence.

Inflationary pressures and increased energy prices in Sri Lanka contributed to higher electricity and operational expenses. Investments in digital infrastructure and system upgrades were necessary to enhance service efficiency and ensure business continuity. The increase in expenses was also influenced by shared costs and staff training investments, reflecting the Company’s commitment to workforce development and operational efficiency. These expenditures align with industry trends, ensuring enhanced service delivery and long-term business sustainability in a competitive market environment.

Financial investments remained the largest component, accounting for 79% of total assets, while the remaining 21% comprised insurance receivables, reinsurance receivables, Property, plant & equipment, other assets, and cash & cash equivalents. This asset growth highlights the Company’s resilience in navigating economic challenges while maintaining a strong financial position. 0 3,000 6,000 9,000 12,000 15,000 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Asset Growth Rs.

Adhering to the Risk- Based Capital (RBC) guidelines set by the IRCSL, PI strategically maintains a well-balanced portfolio focused on stability and credit quality. A significant portion of investments is allocated to secure instruments, with Treasury Bills (51%), Fixed Deposits (26%), Debentures (10%), Treasury Bonds (5%), Unit Trusts (4%), and other assets (4%). This diversified investment mix ensures resilience and sustainable returns amid evolving market conditions. Financial investments are reported as per the guidelines stipulated in SLFRS 9 and details analysis of the investments are provided in the page 228 to 233. The classification of the financial investments are as follows; 2024 2023 Equity instrument at FVTPL 389 - Debt instruments at amortised cost 9,174 9,143 Debt instruments at FVOCI 522 528 Assets Composition 2023 2024 3% 34% 3% 50% 26% 2% 10% 5% 4% 19% 9% 4%1% 30% Staﬀ loans Rent deposits Fixed deposits Savings accounts Treasury bills Debentures Treasury bond Repurchase agreements Unit Trust Total Liabilities Total liabilities of the Company increased by 2% to Rs. 7 Bn in 2024 from Rs. 6.9 Bn in 2023, primarily driven by a increase in insurance contract liabilities from Rs. 4,259 Mn to Rs. 4,852 Mn. Insurance contract liabilities remained the largest component, accounting for 69% of total liabilities, while other liabilities represented 15%. The overall liability movement reflects prudent risk management strategies amid Sri Lanka’s gradual economic recovery, and evolving reinsurance arrangements in response to market dynamics. Insurance Contract Liabilities PI’s insurance contract liabilities stood at Rs. 4.9 Bn as of the reporting date, reflecting a 14% increase from the previous year. These liabilities comprise estimates for the expected ultimate cost of reported claims, claims incurred but not yet reported, and claims incurred but not adequately reported (IBNR/IBNER). The increase in insurance contract liabilities during the financial year was primarily driven by higher provisions for net unearned premium and gross outstanding claims, which rose by approximately Rs. 290 Mn and Rs. 320 Mn, respectively. This growth reflects the Company’s prudent reserving approach in response to evolving claims trends and risk exposures. At the end of each reporting period, insurance companies are required to carry out a Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) according to Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) 4 - Insurance Contracts. LAT is performed to assess the adequacy of the carrying amount of the Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR). PI’s consultant actuaries, NMG has certified that UPR maintained is adequate in relation to the Company’s Unexpired risks as at 31 December 2024. Also, NMG has evaluated the adequacy of the provisioning for Incurred But Not Reported claims (IBNR) as at 31 December 2024 and has determined that the IBNR provision, together with case reserves are adequate to meet future liabilities in respect of claim obligations as at 31 December 2024 as per the guidelines stipulate by the insurance regulator, the IRCSL.

Excess liquidity was strategically allocated to financial instruments and other liquid investments, leading to a Rs. 563 Mn net cash outflow from investing activities. Meanwhile, net cash outflows from financing activities increased to Rs. 86 Mn, mainly due to payments of lease liability and withholding tax on scrip dividend.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 77 Digital Channels Over the years, PI has focused on diversifying its Manufactured Capital through strategic investments aimed at building a robust network of digital channels. This commitment reflects the Company’s focus on advancing customer outreach goals by leveraging technology to provide greater accessibility, seamless service delivery, and a superior customer experience. Asset Rationalisation Asset rationalisation is undertaken for assets that have typically reached the end of their productive lifespan, in line with the Fixed Assets Administration Policy. Accordingly, assets are either discontinued or disposed of based on specific conditions. Underperforming assets that are no longer viable are disposed of. Additionally, if an asset fails to generate the desired income or its financial returns are lower than those of alternative investments, it may be deemed suitable for disposal. Assets that lack potential to support future strategic initiatives, such as regeneration or redevelopment projects, are also considered for rationalisation. Statutory obligations or regulatory requirements may also influence the decision to dispose of certain assets. . Window Offices PI’s Window offices which are stationed at PI’s parent entity- People’s Leasing and Finance PLC branches across Sri Lanka. The existing network of 119 Window Offices across all 9 provinces, which operate on the asset-lite principle stands as a testament to PI’s efforts to improve the efficiency of its Manufactured Capital.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 84 Performance Management Operating in a highly competitive and fast-paced insurance industry, PI acknowledges that a well-structured performance management framework is essential in ensuring that employees remain focused, motivated, and results- driven. For that reason, PI has implemented a fully automated Performance Management System (PMS) that begins with an annual goal-setting exercise conducted before the start of each financial year, where corporate aspirations are cascaded down to departmental goals and further drilled down into individual targets for Managers and Executives. Performance against targets are captured by the system, enabling supervisors to monitor progress in real time and provide necessary support, either by way of training, mentoring, or coaching, to address gaps and help employees realign with set targets. Decisions regarding salary increments, promotions, and career advancements are also based on the outcomes of the annual performance appraisal. The performance of Non-Executives is monitored on an ongoing basis, coupled with a structured mid-year review and followed by a comprehensive annual performance appraisal at the end of the financial year. These evaluations play a crucial role in identifying employee training and development needs. Employees receiving performance evaluations in FY 2024 GRI 404-3 Employee Category Men Women Chief Manager 100% 100% Senior Manager 100% 100% Manager 100% 100% Senior Executive 100% 100% Executive 100% 100% Junior Executive 100% 100% Non-Executive 100% 100% *Employees who got confirmed by the year ended 31 December 2024. Training and Development Training is seen as vital for building a solid Human Capital base to meet PI’s current and future needs. The Company’s structured approach to employee training combines three key elements: the training plan, the Board-approved training budget, and the Performance Management System (PMS), which collectively provide a well-defined framework for employee development. The training plan is developed annually based on a comprehensive assessment of business needs, industry trends, and individual employee development requirements. It outlines key learning initiatives, technical skills enhancement, leadership development programmes, and other necessary skills for employees to excel in their roles and progress within the Company. Supported by the annual Board approved training budget, the training plan aims to enable employees at all levels to benefit from high-quality learning opportunities to satisfy their respective needs. Additionally, the PMS plays a crucial role in identifying training needs by systematically tracking employee performance via the mid-year reviews and annual performance appraisals. Training interventions typically involve a blended learning approach combining on-the-job training alongside classroom sessions (using both internal and external resources) and further supported by online modules delivered via PI’s e-learning system. In the current financial year the Company invested Rs. 9.2 Mn on training interventions accounting for a collective total of 29,259 training hours for the benefit of 785 employees.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 95 CUSTOMERS GRI 416-1, 416-2 GRI 206-1, 417-1, 417 -2, 417 -3 Considering the historically low insurance penetration in Sri Lanka, PI has over the past 14 years maintained a strong focus on increasing insurance adoption across the Country. In this context, customer segmentation plays a vital role in supporting PI’s efforts to offer a diverse range of insurance solutions to enable customers to achieve their financial security and risk protection goals. Personal Insurance Business Insurance PI’s Product Portfolio Caters to Diverse Customer Segments Fair Pricing and Market Equity Prudent underwriting and strong actuarial principles serve as the foundational pillars of the PI’s pricing strategies. Guided by these principles, PI’s expert underwriting teams adopt the risk-based pricing mechanism to ensure customer premiums are priced fairly taking cognisance of the benefits they will receive through their insurance cover. In this regard comprehensive risk assessments support competitive pricing structures for motor and non-motor (fire, engineering, miscellaneous, marine) policies. Further, PI refrains from engaging in anti-competitive, antitrust or monopolistic behaviour. This is demonstrated through a firm commitment to responsible marketing, communications, and product disclosures in strict adherence to the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) guidelines, which mandates transparency in presenting policy terms, conditions, exclusions, and benefits. Guided by these underlying principles, PI remains dedicated to provide a proper understanding of the policy terms and conditions and the added fees related to a policy. Similarly, all advertising and promotional materials and in-person assistance, all align with IRCSL’s fair marketing principles, ensuring that communications are truthful, clear, and free from misleading claims. There were no allegations or legal action brought against the Company in relation to anti-competitive, anti-trust or monopolistic behaviour in the current financial year. No incidents regarding non-compliance of product and service information and labelling or non-compliance concerning marketing communications, were reported in the current financial year. Market-Responsive Product Portfolio PI strives to maintain a product portfolio consisting of a versatile range of insurance solutions to match the dynamic and fast evolving needs of the individuals and business in Sri Lanka. Understanding the market remains the first step towards achieving this. PI follows a systematic approach to New Product Development, wherein representations made by the sales team and based on emerging business requirements is the need is escalated to the technical underwriting team either for new product development or refinement of existing offerings with due consideration of timeliness, relevance and viability vis-a-vis the market. The technical team is further responsible for ensuring all new products and enhancements are in line with regulatory compliance requirements and also reflect PI’s commitments to ensure its insurance products contribute to preserving customer safety and resilience. No incidents on compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services, were reported in FY 2024. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

This is particularly important in Sri Lanka, where the insurance market is still growing, and PI must ensure that it can withstand significant losses in the event of large- scale claims, such as those arising from natural disasters or catastrophic events. These partnerships have also proven invaluable in expanding PI’s product offerings and gaining access to expertise, data, and proprietary tools to help assess and price risks more accurately. Therefore, establishing relationships with new reinsurers requires careful consideration, due diligence, and clear communication. The process involves identifying suitable reinsurers, assessing their financial strength, negotiating terms, and building trust through ongoing collaboration.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 160 Directors’ Statement on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The following statement is presented by the Board of Directors to be in line with Section 9.16 (ii) – Corporate governance requirements of Listing rules issued by Colombo stock exchange section D1.5 of the Code of Best Practices on Corporate Governance 2023 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Responsibility The Board of Directors (Board) is responsible for the adequacy and effectiveness of the Internal Control system and sound risk management practices within the Company in order to safeguard the shareholder’s investment and the Company’s assets. Internal controls over financial reporting are primarily designed to identify and highlight any deviations in the control environment including information systems, operational processes, control activities and monitoring. However, due to the inherent nature of the internal control mechanism, systems of internal control are intended to manage, rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. In view of this, the system of internal controls can only provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material misstatements of financial information or losses and frauds. The Board has established an on- going process to ensure the significant risks faced by the Company are identified, evaluated and managed within an acceptable risk profile and this process includes enhancing the system of internal control as and when there are changes to the business environment or regulatory guidelines. The process is in place and reviewed by the Board through the Board Audit Committee, assisted by the Internal Auditors. With the view of improving the Internal Control Environment, the Board has reviewed the internal control deficiencies identified and relevant recommendations reported by the Board Audit Committee and other subcommittees and directed the management to take appropriate actions to strengthen the control activity. The Management assists the Board in the implementation of the policies and procedures on risk and control by identifying and assessing the risks faced in the design, operation and monitoring of deviations to mitigate and control these risks. System of Internal Control The board has implemented the following in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the proper system of internal controls are in place: Several Board Sub-committees are established by the Board including those mandatory as required in line with the revised listing rules of CSE Srilanka, to assist the Board in ensuring the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and that those are in accordance with the corporate objectives, strategies, annual budgets and business direction. Policies are developed covering all key functional areas of the Company and these are approved by the Board or Board approved sub-committees. Such policies are reviewed for capturing emerging risks, aligning with latest regulatory requirements and industry best practices, and approved periodically. During the year Board reviewed all key functions and initiatives were taken to strengthen the corporate governance and information security policy framework of the Company in addition to the technical and operational areas. Consequently Company implemented a range of corporate governance and risk management policies, aligning with the requirements stipulated under Section 9.2 of the listing rules issued by CSE Srilanka. The internal audit department reviews for compliance with policies and procedures and the effectiveness of the internal control systems on an on-going basis using samples and rotational procedures and highlights significant findings in respect of any non-compliance. Audits are carried out on significant processes in accordance with the audit plan which is developed on risk based approach and approved by the Board Audit Committee. Findings of the internal audits are submitted to the Board Audit Committee for review at periodic meetings. The Board Audit Committee of the Company reviews the outcome of the audits carried out on internal control systems, by internal auditors, external auditors and regulatory authorities, and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management processes and the internal control systems as well as follow-up on remedial measures adopted on reported key audit findings.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 180 Risk Management Overview Given the highly dynamic nature of its operations, People’s Insurance PLC (PI) risk universe is constantly evolving, influenced by changes in the regulatory landscape, economic conditions, technological advancements, and emerging market trend, making effective management of risks imperative to achieving the Company’s business objectives, over the short medium and long term. As risks become increasingly interconnected, PI has discovered that multiple risks can converge to impact a single business objective, requiring careful coordination and mitigation strategies. On the other hand, a single risk may have far- reaching consequences across several objectives, underscoring the importance of early identification, continuous monitoring, and proactive responses. Acknowledging the complexity of its risk universe, PI adopts a holistic and forward-looking approach to risk management to strike a balance between resilience and sustainable value creation. Approach to Risk Management PI’s Risk Management Policy serves as an overarching mandate for the effective management of risks within the organisation. The Risk Management Policy was implemented in mid-2024 in line with section 9 of the new CSE listing rules on Corporate Governance. The Board approved Policy formalises the Integrated Risk Management Framework to support effective decision-making in order to mitigate potential threats, while leverage opportunities for sustained business growth. To that end the framework establishes a comprehensive system of polices, procedures and protocols for identifying, assessing, and mitigating all financial and non-financial risks as well as emerging risks, ensuring all significant risks are considered, and every potential threat is evaluated within the context of its possible impact on the organisation. PI’s Risk Management Policy serves as an overarching mandate for the effective management of risks within the organisation. The Risk Management Policy was implemented in mid-2024 in line with section 9 of the new CSE listing rules on Corporate Governance. Board of Directors Serves as the apex governing body for PI’s Integrated Risk Management Framework (IRMF). Board Audit Committee Reviews regulatory risk reports, evaluates the effectiveness of internal controls, and ensures compliance with statutory requirements. Investment Committee Formulates strategic investment plans, ensures adherence to regulatory guidelines and monitors the performance of investment portfolios.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 182 Risk Management Risk Appetite Statement and Tolerance Limits A prudent and conservative Risk Appetite serves as the foundation of PI’s Integrated Risk Management Framework. Based on the principle that a well-defined risk appetite supports effective risk management the Board has established a Risk Appetite Statement defining the acceptable level of risk PI is prepared to assume to achieve its strategic objectives. The Risk Appetite Statement acts as an umbrella framework from which cascades tolerance limits for managing specific risks within acceptable levels. Risk tolerance limits for each risk category are set at different trigger levels, with clearly defined escalation criteria to report significant risks issues and/or limit breaches. Stress Testing Stress Testing is a fundamental aspect of PI’s Integrated Risk Management Framework. By simulating adverse economic, market, and operational conditions, stress testing helps identify potential vulnerabilities, evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, and ensure that capital adequacy and liquidity positions remain robust under stress conditions. A comprehensive Stress Testing Policy was approved by the PI Board in mid 2024. The policy, which was developed in line with section 9 of the new CSE listing rules on Corporate Governance, details the protocols for assessing vulnerability across various risks to enable assignment of risk score (high, medium, low) for the purpose of setting tolerance limits. The policy mandates routine quarterly stress testing to measure performance against established tolerance limits, thereby providing a data-driven approach to understand vulnerabilities and implement appropriate remedial action as needed to mitigate risk impacts. Capital Planning Capital planning is a key component of PI’s Integrated Risk Management Framework. The purpose of the Capital Planning Process is to ensure the Company maintains adequate capital and liquidity buffers to support its business objectives while adhering to regulatory requirements, both during regular business cycles and stressed environments. A well-structured capital planning approach also strengthens PI’s financial resilience and provides the flexibility to capitalise on future investment opportunities. Target Actual for FY 2024 Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) Minimum > 120% 389% Supervisory limit > 160% Total Available Capital (TAC) > Rs. 500 Mn Rs. 5,183 Mn Risk Awareness Culture The effectiveness of the Integrated Risk Management Framework to a great extent depends on the culture of risk awareness. To reinforce this, the Board of Directors sets the tone from the top to promote the risk-conscious mindset across the organisation. Training and capacity-building initiatives are carried out regularly to empower employees at all levels develop the necessary knowledge, behaviours, and skills to proactively identify and report risks that could potentially impact the Company’s strategic objectives.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 183 FINANCIAL RISKS Underwriting Risk As a general insurer, PI is exposed to underwriting risk is most commonly the result of pricing inaccuracies, the frequency and severity of claims and shifts in policyholder behaviour induced by various externalities. Effective management of underwriting risks is therefore essential to maintaining financial stability, profitability, and long- term sustainability. PI’s dedicated team of experienced underwriters carefully assesses risks to ensure pricing remains accurate and reflective of market conditions. Underwriters are guided by established underwriting principles including actuarial models and historical data analysis to focus on risk-based pricing strategies that ensure premiums accurately reflect underlying risks. In 2024, the Company rigorously monitored underwriting results, strategically phasing out loss-making clients from the portfolio. Regular reviews of the product portfolio’s profitability, pricing, and terms were conducted to identify and implement necessary adjustments. These efforts were coupled with extensive training and capacity-building to enhance the core competencies of the Company’s underwriting teams. Additionally, PI continued to operate in full compliance with regulatory reporting obligations by notifying the relevant authorities whenever underwriting approvals exceeded prescribed limits.

A comprehensive Claims Manual sets out guidelines for the claims approval process, including stringent due diligence to verify the authenticity of claims alongside clearly delineated roles and responsibilities for approval and payment claims. Regular reviews of the claims manual are conducted by the Board Audit Committee, with updates incorporated as necessary to reflect new developments.

To effectively manage this risk, claims are promptly assessed upon intimation and reserved accordingly. Additionally an independent, qualified actuary performs quarterly evaluations of the reserves to ensure their adequacy, while significant outstanding claims are subject to periodic reviews by both Management and the Board of Directors.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 184 Risk Management Credit Risk on Insurance Receivables Credit risk on insurance receivables arises when policyholders face difficulties in settling their premium. PI’s approach to managing Credit Risk on Insurance receivables is based on timely collections to minimise overdue balances. A structured monitoring and follow- up mechanism is in place to track outstanding premiums, with a key objective of maintaining receivables past 90 days below 10% of total receivables. To that end, the Company’s multiple payment channels, including digital platforms have been made available to facilitate convenient settlement of premium. In cases where payments are not received within the stipulated time frame, policy cancellations may be enforced as an additional safeguard to protect the company against undue financial risk in the event of a future claim. Moreover as part of the overall risk mitigation approach, claim settlements are contingent on the policyholders premium payment history. Accordingly, claims are processed only if all outstanding premiums have been cleared. To further strengthen its risk mitigation framework, periodic reviews of premium receivables are conducted to assess potential defaults. Based on these assessments, impairment provisions are recorded in the Company’s financial statements. Target Actual Premium receivable >90 days <10% 4.51% Concentration Risk Concentration Risk arises due to the lack of diversification within PI’s investment portfolio resulting in excessive exposure to a single industry, geographic region, or asset class. Such imbalances increase financial vulnerability, particularly in times of market fluctuations or economic downturns. Concerntration Risk Government Securities Fixed Deposits Corporate Debt Unit Trusts/Mutual Funds 57% 29% 10% 4% A disciplined and forward-looking approach underpins PI’s efforts to minimise concentration risk and enhance portfolio resilience. The Company’s Investment Operations Manual sets out concentration limits for various investment categories, including listed equity, government securities, fixed deposits, and other financial instruments to support the creation of a diversified portfolio that aligns with the company’s risk appetite and regulatory standards. The Board Investment Committee plays a critical role in monitoring and reviewing individual exposures at both the entity and group levels. These reviews are conducted periodically to assess compliance with internal risk thresholds and external regulatory requirements The Board also evaluates the investment portfolio on a monthly basis vis-a-vis Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) guidelines for concentration risks. Target Actual Government Securities Up to 100% 57% Fixed deposits <65% 29% Listed equity <30% - Corporate debt <65% 10% Unit trusts/ mutual funds <30% 4% Commercial paper <30% - Reinsurance Risk Reinsurance risk refers to the potential financial exposure that arises if PI’s risk-bearing capacity is not adequately supported by reliable and cost-effective reinsurance arrangements. To mitigate against Reinsurance Risk, PI partners exclusively with reputable global reinsurance companies that maintain strong ratings from agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and A.M. Best. As part of the overall risk management strategy, monthly reviews are carried out to track outstanding reinsurance receivables, to ensure insurance receivables more than 180 days do not exceed 5% of PI’s total reinsurance receivables. As an added safeguard, reinsurance arrangements are reviewed annually to determine coverage adequacy. Market Risk PI has no significant exposure to market risks in relation to interest rates, currency or commodity prices. The Board Investment Committee provides oversight to ensure that market fluctuations, including interest rate and foreign exchange risks, are managed effectively. Liquidity Risk PI is exposed to Liquidity Risk due to inadequate cash flows to meet as result financial obligations, such as claim settlements and reinsurance payments. Given the nature of the insurance business, maintaining a strong liquidity position is essential to ensuring operational stability and the ability to respond promptly to policyholder claims. As such, a structured liquidity management process under the oversight of the Investment Committee aims to reduce exposure to liquidity constraints. Routine cash flow monitoring ensures proactive assessment and timely adjustments to liquidity to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover claims and operational costs. Meanwhile the adequacy of reserves are reviewed REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 185 and periodically adjusted to factor for expected disruptions, while contingency planning with predefined strategies are in place for securing credit facilities and short-term borrowing if needed. Credit Risk – Financial Instruments Credit risk on financial instruments arises due to the failure to meet its obligations for interest or principal payments. At PI, this risk is managed under the guidance of the Investment Committee, where exposures are classified into distinct credit risk grades. Under the direction of the Committee investments, a majority exposure is on financial instruments rated A- and above. Credit Rating As at 31 December 2024 Government securities and AAA+ 57% AAA to AA- 1% A+ to A- 31% BBB+ to BBB- 1% BB+ & below 7% Unrated* 3% Each exposure is evaluated regularly based on available financial data and tracking the creditworthiness of issuers, including tracking changes in the credit ratings of counterparties and instruments. Business Risk Business risk arises from the potential for underperformance due to unforeseen changes in internal or external environments. For PI, this includes the impact of prolonged government restrictions on vehicle imports, which continues to adversely affect growth in the motor insurance sector. Business risk is managed under the supervision of the Board, Board Committees, and Corporate Management, in alignment with the Board-approved three-year strategic plan to expand core business operations. The Board periodically reviews actual performance metrics against targets, enabling timely strategic realignment in response to broader macroeconomic developments. OPERATIONAL RISKS Information Technology (IT) Risk Information Technology (IT) Risk refers to the potential disruptions caused by system failures, breakdowns, or cyber security threats that can potentially disrupt operations and expose the Company to data loss or exploitation. PI follows a structured IT risk management approach guided by comprehensive Group IT policies covering IT discipline, licensed software usage, internet and email monitoring, mail server oversight, and antivirus and firewall protection as well as Unified Threat Management (UTM) systems and Sophos Endpoint Security and Control solutions. These software systems are further supported by a robust Information Security Policy framework, which includes specific guidelines for information security, email usage, and password management. PI has invested. Regular maintenance of an off-site backup system further safeguards against data loss. These security measures are continuously evaluated through periodic IT and Cyber Security risk reviews conducted by the Audit Committee and the Board. More recently, the Company has expanded its risk assessment framework to include both product- based risk assessments for new IT products and process-based risk assessments for IT operations, ensuring a proactive and comprehensive approach to managing technology- related risks. Human Resource Risk Human Resource Risk refers to the potential disruption of the Company’s operations due to high employee turnover, skill gap and leadership succession challenges all of which could hinder the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives. PI’s primary approach to minimising human capital risk is based on a broad based human capital development that includes a robust recruitment strategy that revolves around competitive compensation packages and career development opportunities to attract and retain top talent. Continuous learning remains a priority, with structured training programmes focused on developing technical, leadership, and soft skills. At the same time, a robust succession planning framework identifies and nurtures high-potential employees, ensuring leadership stability and long-term business continuity. Product Design Risk Product Design Risk arises when offerings fail to align with market needs and customer expectations, potentially impacting competitiveness and growth. PI’s customer-centric approach which focuses on ongoing feedback ensures continuous improvement in products to improve their relevance in an evolving market landscape. STRATEGIC RISKS Reputation Risk Reputation Risk encompasses the potential damage to PI’s reputation and industry standing due to poor decision-making, including but not limited to violations of business ethics, non-compliance, customer service deficiencies, or operational shortcomings. A timely and effective response to address negative stakeholder perceptions is essential to mitigating this risk. Regulatory Risk Regulatory risk pertains to the potential impact on business operations arising from changes in laws and regulations, including risks associated with non- compliance.

Similarly in anticipation of the Data Subject Rights under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) set to come into effect from September 2025 onwards, the Data Protection Officer and Risk & Compliance Officer commenced work on developing a dedicated Data Protection Management Programme to ensure full compliance in line with the stipulated timeline. SUSTAINABILITY RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES In 2024, PI took its first steps toward reporting on Sustainability-Related Risks and Opportunities (SRROs) and Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities (CRROs) in preparation for the Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) S1 and S2, set to take effect in January 2025. It is hoped that these preparatory measures will pave the way for the Company to transition to reporting on SLFRS S1 and S2 standards thereby ensuring greater transparency and accountability in sustainability and climate risk reporting.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 206 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.4 Financial period The financial statements are prepared to a financial year ended 31 December. 2.5 Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the statement of profit or loss unless required or permitted by an accounting standards or interpretation. 2.6 Comparative information The presentation and classification of assets and liabilities in the financial statements of the previous year have been amended, where relevant for better presentation and to be comparable with those of the current year. 2.7 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (Rs.) which is the functional currency of the Company. 2.8 Materiality and aggregation Each material class of similar items is presented separately. Items of dissimilar nature or functions are presented separately unless they are immaterial. 2.9 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements of the Company in conformity with SLFRS and LKAS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Further, the management is also required to consider key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Accounting judgments, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The key significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions involving uncertainty are discussed below whereas the respective carrying amounts of such assets and liabilities are given in related notes. 2.9.1 Going concern In determining the basis of preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, based on available information, In addition to that, the management of the Company evaluated the resilience of the business considering a wide range of factors under multiple stress tested scenarios, relating to expected premium volumes, volatility of claims, expense management, profitability, ability to defer non-essential capital expenditure, reinsurance payment timelines, liquidity of the investment portfolio and the ability to continue providing services to ensure businesses continue as least impacted as possible. The management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for a foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. In determining the above significant management judgements, estimates and assumptions. 2.9.2 Assessment of impairment The Company’s expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgments and estimates include: • The external credit grading model, which assigns probability of defaults (PDs) to the individual grade • The Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk and so allowances for financial assets should be measured on a life-time expected credit loss (LTECL) basis and the qualitative assessment • The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis • Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs • Determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and, economic inputs, such as gross domestic product and the effect on probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given defaults (LGD) • Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings to derive the economic inputs into the ECL models 2.9.3 Provisions for liabilities and contingencies The Company receives legal claims against it in the normal course of business. The management has made judgments as to the likelihood of any claim succeeding in making provisions. The time of concluding legal claims is uncertain, as is the amount of possible outflow of economic benefits. Timing and cost ultimately depend on the due process in respective legal jurisdictions. 2.9.4 Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to the Company which can be utilised against such tax losses. Judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 207 that can be recognised, based on the likely timing and level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies. Details on deferred tax assets are disclosed in Note 26 on page 225 to the financial statements. 2.9.5 Valuation of insurance contract liabilities The estimates of insurance contracts have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred, but not yet reported and claims incurred, but not enough reported (IBNR/IBNER) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty. The main assumption underlying in estimating the amount of outstanding claims is the past claims development experience. Large claims are usually addressed separately, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios. 2.9.6 Employee defined benefit obligation Employee defined benefit obligations are determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increments, withdrawal rates and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature and the valuation complexity, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed annually at each reporting date. In determining the discount rate, the management considers the interest rates of the Government of Sri Lanka treasury bonds with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of defined benefit obligation. Future expected inflation rates and salary increment rates of the Group are considered in determining the salary increases. Details of the key assumptions used by the Actuary and sensitivities there on the estimation are contained in Note 38 on page 240. 3.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 208 Notes to the Financial Statements Other significant accounting policies which have been applied commonly by the Company are as follows; 3.1 Foreign currency transaction The Company’s financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees which is also the Company’s functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the statement of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction and are not subsequently restated. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. 3.2 Impairment of non-financial assets The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating units (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed, only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. 3.3 Amortised cost measurement The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 3.4 Impairment of financial assets 3.4.1 Overview of the ECL principles Based on forward-looking impairment approach, the Company has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all insurance receivables and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL in this section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under SLFRS 9. The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined in Note 3.4.2. The Company’s policies for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk are set out in Note 45.D. The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The Company’s policy for Companying financial assets measured on a collective basis is explained in Note. 45.D.i. The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. This is further explained in Note 45.D.i. based on the above process, the Company groups its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below: Stage 1: When financial instruments are first recognised, the Company recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 2: When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 financial instrument also include instruments, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. Stage 3: Financial instruments considered credit-impaired (as outlined in Note 45.D.i). The Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. 3.4.2 The calculation of ECLs The Company calculates ECLs based on a four probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows:

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 209 • PD - The probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. The concept of PD is further explained in Note 45.D.e. • EAD - The exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. • LGD - The loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the counterparty would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD. LGD is further explained in Note 45.D.e. When estimating ECLs, the Company considers three scenarios (a base case, good and bad). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGD as set out in Note 45.D.i when relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted financial instruments are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the instrument will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset. • Definition of Default - The Company defines default and classification as Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations for collective purpose when receivables are overdue by more than 150 days for non-government businesses and 300 days for government businesses. 3.4.3 The mechanics of the ECL method The mechanics of the ECL method are summarised below: Stage 1: The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Company calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original effective interest rate (EIR). This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios, as explained above. Stage 2: When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records an allowance for the LTECLs. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs and LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. Stage 3: For financial instruments considered credit-impaired (as defined in Note 45.D.i), the Company recognises the lifetime expected credit losses for these loans. The method is similar to that for stage 2 assets, with the PD set at 100%. 3.4.4 Forward looking information The inputs and models used for calculating ECLs may not always capture all characteristics of the market at the date of the financial statements. To reflect this, qualitative adjustments or overlays are occasionally made as temporary adjustments when such differences are significantly material. 3.4.5 Impairment of debt instruments measured at fair value through OCI The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount with a corresponding charge to the statement of profit or loss. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the statement of profit and loss upon de-recognition of the assets. 3.5 Provisions General Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 210 4. NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED 4.1 SLFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts The following SLFRSs have been issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka that have an effective date in the future and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Those SLFRSs will have an effect on the accounting policies currently adopted by the Company and may have an impact on the future financial statements. Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standard (SLFRS) 17 – Insurance Contracts The institute of chartered accountants of Sri Lanka issued SLFRS 17- Insurance Contracts in January 2023, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 01 January 2026, with earlier application permitted. SLFRS 17 supersedes SLFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts, an interim standard that allows entities to use a wide variety of accounting practices for insurance contracts which includes insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. The standard contains a core measurement approach to measure groups of insurance contracts known as ‘General Model’. Apart from the core measurement model, if certain criteria are met, an entity may apply a simplified version of general model known as Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) and Variable Fee Approach (VFA) for the contracts with direct participation features. The SLFRS 17 model combines a current balance sheet measurement of insurance contracts with recognition of profit over the period that services are provided. The general model in the standard requires insurance contract liabilities to be measured using probability weighted current estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment for risk and a contractual service margin representing the profit expected from fulfilling the contracts. The main features of the new accounting model for insurance contracts are as follows: • The measurement of the present value of future cash flows, incorporating an explicit risk adjustment, remeasured every reporting period (the fulfilment cash flows) • A Contractual Service Margin (CSM) that is equal and opposite to any day one gain in the fulfilment cash flows of a group of contracts. The CSM represents the unearned profits of insurance contracts and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the service period (i.e. coverage period) • Certain changes in the expected present value of future cash flows are adjusted against the CSM and thereby recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the remaining contractual service period • The effect of changes in discount rates will be reported in either in the statement of profit or loss or other comprehensive income, determined by an accounting policy choice • The recognition of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the statement of comprehensive income based on the concept of services provided during the period • Amounts that the policyholder will always receive, regardless of whether an insured event happens (non-distinct investment components) are not presented in the statement of profit or loss, but are recognised directly on the statement of financial position. • Insurance services results (earned revenue less incurred claims) are presented separately from the insurance finance income or expense • Extensive disclosures to provide information on the recognized amounts from insurance contracts and the nature and extent of risks arising from these contracts The Company has an ongoing implementation process to ensure the successful adherence with the standard by 2026. According to the position papers concluded, significant portion of the Company’s products will be qualified to be measured under the simplified Premium Allocation Approach. The Company is currently in process of evaluating and finalizing the applicable accounting policies, transition approach including the possible effects on comparative information, impact on current practices of the Company and the appropriate methodology for implementation. As such, the financial impact of initial application of SLFRS 17 Insurance Contracts has not been disclosed in these financial statements as it is not yet reasonably estimable. 4.2 Amendments to LKAS 21- Lack of exchangeability The amendments provide guidance on how an entity should evaluate the exchangeability of a currency and establish a spot exchange rate in cases where exchangeability is absent. They also mandate disclosures that help users of financial statements comprehend the effects of a currency's non-exchangeability. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2025. 5. OPERATING SEGMENTS Basis of Segmentation Operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available. For the management purposes, the Company has mainly classified overall business in to motor and non-motor segments and non-motor segment has been further classified in to three main segments based on their products and services. The segmental information reported below is used by the chief operating decision maker for the allocation of resources and assessment of performance. Notes to the Financial Statements

CHANGE IN RESERVE FOR UNEARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM ACCOUNTING POLICY Unearned reinsurance premium is the proportion of premium written in a year that relates to periods of risk after the reporting date. Unearned reinsurance premium is deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies. Change in reserve for unearned reinsurance premium represents the net portion of the reinsurance premium transferred to the unearned reinsurance premium reserve during the year to cover the unexpired period of the policies.

FEE INCOME ACCOUNTING POLICY Policyholders are charged for policy administration services and other contract fees. These fees are recognised recognised on accrual basis. For the year ended 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Rs. Rs. Policy fees 79,199,465 73,423,405 Administration fees 19,688,395 13,472,563 98,887,860 86,895,968 12 . NET CLAIMS ACCOUNTING POLICY Recognition of gross claims Gross claims for non-life insurance include all claims occurring during the year, whether reported or not, related external claims handling costs that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims, a reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years. Claims outstanding are assessed by review of individual claim files and estimating changes in the ultimate cost of settling claims. Claims expenses and liabilities for outstanding claims are recognised in respect of direct insurance business. The liability covers claims reported but not yet paid, incurred but not reported claims (IBNR) and the anticipated direct and indirect costs of settling those claims. The provision in respect of IBNR is actuarially valued on a quarterly basis to ensure a more realistic estimation of the future liability based on past experience and trends. While the Directors consider that the provision for claims is fairly stated on the basis of information currently available, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events. This may result in adjustment to the amounts provided. Such amounts are reflected in the financial statements for that period. The methods used and the estimates made are reviewed regularly. Recognition of reinsurance claims Reinsurance claims are recognised when the related gross insurance claim is recognised according to the terms of the relevant contract. Claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue or expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business. Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs.

A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company recognises the changes in the defined benefit obligations under staff expenses in the statement of profit or loss. (a) current service cost (b) interest cost For more details please refer Note 38 on defined benefit obligations. Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay a further amount. Obligations for contributions to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) under the Employees’ Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) under the Employees’ Trust Fund Act No. 46 of 1980, covering all employees are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss when they are due.

Interest expense on lease liability 61,625,721 73,352,627 16. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ACCOUNTING POLICY Interest income Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as it accrues and is calculated by using the effective interest rate method. Under SLFRS 9, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for all financial instruments measured at amortised cost. Interest income on interest bearing financial assets measured at FVOCI are also recorded by using the EIR method under SLFRS 9. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the dividend is established. For the year ended 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs. Interest income 16.1 1,178,784,913 1,458,336,410 1,178,784,913 1,458,336,410

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 221 21. BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) ACCOUNTING POLICY Company presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares which comprise share options granted to employees. For the year ended 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Profit for the year (Rs.) 429,421,407 521,578,016 Weighted average number of shares (Re-stated 2023) 202,020,255 202,020,255 Basic earnings per share (Rs.) 2.13 2.58 As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Number of shares 200,000,000 200,000,000 Issued ordinary shares as at 31 December 3,632,478 - Shares issued during the year 203,632,478 200,000,000 21.1 Diluted earnings per share There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares outstanding at any time during the year. Therefore, diluted earnings per share is same as the basic earnings per share stated above. 22. DIVIDENDS For the year ended 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Rs. Rs. Scrip dividend paid 85,000,000 - Dividend per ordinary share 0.5 - 23. INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company’s intangible assets include the value of acquired computer software. Basis of recognition An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Software acquired by the Company is initially measured at cost and subsequently stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of services to be rendered. Amortisation is recorded in the statement of profit or loss. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. Amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and they are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and cost incurred subsequently to add to or replace a part of it. The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring at the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as a part of computer equipment. The Company applies the cost model to plant and equipment and records at cost of purchase or construction together with any incidental expenses thereon less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the assets when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of performance of the existing assets will flow to the Company and the renovation replaces an identifiable part of the asset. Major renovations are depreciated during the remaining useful life of the related asset. Depreciation Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation charge begins when an assets is available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows; Asset class Useful life Computer hardware 5 years Office equipment 5 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Motor vehicles 5 years De-recognition Carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from it. Gain or loss arising from the de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is included in the statement of profit or loss when the item is de-recognised. When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is de- recognised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspection is de- recognised.

Cash payments amounting to Rs. 94,203,384 (2023 - Rs. 26,723,316) were made during the year to purchase property, plant and equipment. 24.4 Property, plant and equipment pledged as security for liabilities There were no items of property, plant and equipment pledged as securities for liabilities as at the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023 - Nil). 24.5 Capitalisation of borrowing cost There were no capitalised borrowing costs relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment during the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023 - Nil). 24.6 Temporarily idle property, plant and equipment There were no temporarily idle property, plant and equipment as at the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023 - Nil). 24.7 Assessment of impairment of property, plant and equipment The Board of Directors has assessed the potential impairment indicators of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2024. Based on the assessment, no impairment indicators were identified and therefore no impairment provision is required to be made in the financial statements as at the reporting date in respect of property, plant and equipment. 24.8 Amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment There are no contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as at the reporting date. 25. LEASE AND RIGHT OF USE ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICY At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company uses the definition of a lease in SLFRS 16. 25.1 Right-of-use assets The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option if applicable. In that case, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right- of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. As at 2024 2023 Rs. Rs. Land and building Balance as at 01 January 269,910,053 332,113,002 Depreciation charged for the year (84,287,468) (80,402,017) Additions to right-of-use assets 33,770,932 18,199,068 De-recognition of right- of-use assets (2,239,770) - Balance as at 31 December 217,153,747 269,910,053

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 225 25.2 Lease liability The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Company presents right-of-use assets and lease liabilities both in ‘Right of use assets’ in the statement of financial position. As at 2024 2023 Rs. Rs.

These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the asset used in the Company’s operations. The extension and termination options held are exercisable with the three months written consent by either party. 26. DEFERRED TAX ASSET ACCOUNTING POLICY Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: • When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 226 Notes to the Financial Statements Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit or loss is recognised outside statement of profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. The Company establishes provisions based on the tax laws and interpretations. As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 228 Notes to the Financial Statements 27. FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICY Recognition and initial measurement The classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for managing the instruments, as described in business model assessment and the SPPI test below. Financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at FVTPL, transaction costs are added to, or subtracted from this amount. When the fair value of financial instruments at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, the Company accounts for the day one profit or loss as described below. Measurement categories of financial assets The Company classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the asset’s contractual terms, measured at either: *Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) as explained in Note 27.1 *Debt instruments at amortised cost as explained in Note 27.2 *Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) as explained in Note 27.3 De-recognition and substantial modification A financial asset (or where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Company also de-recognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for de-recognition. Offsetting of financial investments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when and only when the Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Company’s financial investments are summarised below based on measurement category. Debt instruments at FVTPL and debt instruments at FVOCI have been valued at fair value. Debt instruments at amortised cost has been valued at amortised cost. As at Carrying value Fair value 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. Equity instrument at FVTPL 27.1 389,064,535 - 389,064,535 - Debt instruments at amortised cost 27.2 9,174,297,805 9,143,132,818 9,644,334,621 10,022,674,758 Debt instruments at FVOCI 27.3 522,471,501 528,052,500 515,886,000 528,052,500 10,085,833,841 9,671,185,318 10,549,285,156 10,550,727,258 27.1 Fair value through profit or loss ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company classifies financial assets as held for trading when they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking. FVTPL assets are recorded and measured in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised under ‘Fair value gains/(losses)’ in the statement of profit or loss. Dividend income is recorded in ‘Interest and dividend income’ when the right to payment has been established.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 229 27.2 Debt instruments at amortised cost ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company only measures insurance receivables, reinsurance receivables and financial investments at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: 1. The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. 2. The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. The details of these conditions are outlined below; Business model assessment The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Company’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: - How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel As at Carrying value Fair value 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs.

If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Company’s original expectations, the Company does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward. The SPPI test As a second step of its classification process the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. Principal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/ discount).

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 230 The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Company applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set. In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimise exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is to be measured at FVTPL. Impairment The Company recognises loss allowances for ECL on assets subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except financial investments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. Refer Note 3.4 for further details on ECL policy. As at Carrying value Fair value 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs.

No expected credit losses (ECL) are recognised for government securities since those are rated as risk free investments. Balance existed as at 31 December 2024 was NIL (2023 - Rs. 400,214,795). 27.2.2 Staff loans The Company grants vehicle loans and supporting loans for the employees of the company. Terms of the staff loans and interest rate prevailing for the staff loans as follows ; Loan category Interest rate Term Vehicle loans 6% 8 years (maximum) Supporting loans - 3 years (maximum) The carrying value of the staff loans has been computed based on the market interest rates which prevailed at the time of granting the loan and the fair value of the same has been computed based on the interest rates prevailed at the reporting date. Impairment of staff loans No expected credit losses (ECL) were recognised for staff loans since those are fully pledged with securities and ability of deducting from the salary. 27.2.3 Fixed deposits The Company has invested in fixed deposits on licensed commercial banks and registered finance companies during the period for a maximum term of 5 year. The interest rates for fixed deposits fluctuate between the range of 6% - 29.75% based on the tenures and the risk of institutions. As at Carrying value 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurance in the normal course of business. Reinsurance receivables represent balances due from reinsurance companies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance contract. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. According to the characteristics relating to reinsurance receivables, the instruments qualify the contractual cash flow characteristic test (SPPI test) as the return solely represent capital and interest. Even though there were no interest charge for reinsurance receivables, they satisfy the SPPI test as they are considered to be short term. Upon completion of the SPPI test, the management elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash flows and measure the instrument at amortised cost as these are short term in nature. Since these are short term balances without a financing component the amortised cost will be equal to carrying value. Assessment of impairment of reinsurance receivables Reinsurance receivables of the Company are not qualified for ECL model based on SLFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts section 20, impairment losses will be recognised on reinsurance receivables, if and only if, there is no objective evidence, as a result that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Company may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract; and that event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Company will receive from the reinsurer. As at 2024 2023 Rs. Rs. Reinsurance receivables on outstanding claims as at 01 January 538,977,303 557,603,560 Reinsurance receivable on outstanding case reserve (78,416,594) 7,458,413 Reinsurance receivable on IBNR cases (9,216,411) (26,084,670) Reinsurance receivables on outstanding claims as at 31 December 451,344,298 538,977,303 As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Rs.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 234 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.1 Reinsurance receivables on outstanding claims This includes reinsurance reserve of claims that has not been paid yet. 28.2 Collateral details The Company does not hold collateral as security against potential default by reinsurance counter parties. 28.3 Fair value of reinsurance receivables The carrying value of reinsurance receivables approximates the fair value at the reporting date. 28.4 Risk management Please refer Note 45.D.for risk management measures taken relating to reinsurance. 29. INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ACCOUNTING POLICY Insurance receivables satisfy the contractual cash flow characteristic test (SPPI test) as the return solely represent capital and interest. Even though there were no interest charge for insurance receivables, they satisfy the SPPI test as they are considered to be short term. Upon completion of the SPPI test, management elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash flows and measure the instrument at amortised cost as these are short term in nature. Since these are short term balances without a financing component, amortised cost will be equal to carrying value. Based on the three stages; performing (stage 1), under-performing (stage 2), non-performing (stage 3), the Company provides ECL on 12 months ECL and lifetime ECL weighted among several scenarios. De-recognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions The Company de-recognises premium receivables, when the terms and conditions have been re-negotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new insurance contract, with the difference recognised as a separate asset or liability. The newly recognised insurance contracts are classified as stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes. When assessing whether or not to de-recognise a insurance premium receivable, amongst others, the Company considers the following factors: • Loss of insurable interest • Change in counterparty Assessment of impairment of insurance receivables The Company assessed the impairment provision based on the ECL method. The analysis of the impairment provision under three categories is provided below. As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Note Rs. Rs.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 235 29.3 Collateral details The Company does not hold any collateral as security against potential default by policyholders. 29.4 Fair value of insurance receivables The carrying amount disclosed above approximates the fair value at the reporting date. 29.5 Risk management Please refer Note 45. (D) for risk management measures taken relating to insurance receivables. 30. DEFERRED EXPENSES / INCOME ACCOUNTING POLICY Acquisition expenses Costs of acquiring new businesses including commission, underwriting, marketing and policy issuance expenses which vary with and directly related to production of new businesses are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums. All other acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, deferred acquisition costs (DAC) are amortised over the period on the basis unearned premium is amortised. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period and are treated as a change in an accounting estimate. DAC is de-recognised when the related contracts are either expired or cancelled. An impairment review of DAC is performed at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises. When the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. DACs are also considered in the liability adequacy test for each reporting period. Reinsurance commissions Commissions receivable on outward reinsurance contracts are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the expected premiums payable.

INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY Provision for net unearned premium Provision for unearned premium represents premiums received for risks that have not yet expired. Generally, the reserve is released over the term of the contract and is recognised as premium income. At each reporting date, the Company reviews its unexpired risk and a liability adequacy test is performed to determine whether there is any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums. This calculation uses current estimates of future contractual cash flows after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the relevant non-life insurance technical provisions. If these estimates show that the carrying amount of the unearned premiums is inadequate, the deficiency is recognised in the statement of profit or loss by setting up a provision for liability adequacy. As required by SLFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts, the Company performs a Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) in respect of non- life contract liabilities with the assistance of an external actuary. Provision for gross outstanding claims Non-life insurance contract liabilities are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged.

The liability is not discounted for the time value of money. No provision for equalisation or catastrophe reserves is recognised. The liabilities are de-recognised when the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled. Provision for gross incurred but not reported claims Delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of claims, therefore the ultimate cost of these cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date. The liability is calculated at the reporting date using a range of standard actuarial claim projection techniques, based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a margin for adverse deviation. For non-life insurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty and for some type of policies, IBNR claims form the majority of the liability in the statement of financial position. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as Chain Ladder method, Bornheutter-Ferguson method and Frequency/Severity method. The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a company’s past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident years, but can also be further analysed by geographical area, as well as by significant business lines and claim types. Large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios. Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future (for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy features and claims handling procedures) in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved. Similar judgments, estimates and assumptions are employed in the assessment of adequacy of provisions for unearned premium.

The valuation is based on internationally accepted actuarial methods and is performed on a quarterly basis. According to the report issued by NMG Financial Services Consulting Pte Limited, the liability carried forward by the Company was adequate. Hence, no provision was made for premium deficiency for the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023 - Nil).

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 240 Notes to the Financial Statements 37.6 Valuation of IBNR and IBNER The incurred but not reported claims reserve has been actuarially computed by NMG Financial Services Consulting Pte Limited as at 31 December 2024. This valuation exercise was carried out to determine the required claim liability reserve (in particular the IBNR reserve) in respect of Company’s non-life Insurance operations, net of reinsurance. The central estimate of the net claim liability has been determined based upon the net analysis performed for People’s Insurance as at 31 December 2024. This is a full review of the loss development factors, such that the value of the insurance liabilities is reflective of People’s Insurance general insurance portfolio at 31 December 2024. The volatility of the central estimate of net claim liability is then projected to secure an overall level of sufficiency of not less than 75% confidence. In assessing the claim liability at a 75% confidence level, the provision of risk margin for adverse deviation (PRAD) loading provided by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) is adopted. The 75th percentile is calculated for each line of business independently using the risk margin highlighted in Table 5 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000, revised on 15 December 2015. During the analysis, classes of business in the Company portfolio were closely matched with the IRCSL prescribed business categories. 37.7 Changes in assumptions There were no material estimation changes from the previous valuation done for the balance as at 31 December 2024. 37.8 Reconciliation between insurance provision and technical reserves As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Rs. Rs. Insurance contract liabilities 4,852,025,556 4,258,822,650 Reinsurance on case reserves (358,407,653) (436,824,246) Reinsurance on IBNR provision (92,936,646) (102,153,056) Deferred expenses 9,364,218 35,044,610 Technical reserves 4,410,045,475 3,754,889,958 38. EMPLOYEE DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability recognised in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the reporting date. The value of defined benefit obligations is calculated by a qualified actuary as at the reporting date, using the Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method as recommended by LKAS 19 - Employee Benefits. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rate, salary increment rate and balance service period of employees. Due to the long-term nature of the plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The re-measurement of the net defined benefit liability which comprises actuarial gains and losses are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The assumptions based on which the results of the actuarial valuation was determined, are included in Note 38.1.4 to the financial statements. However, according to the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability for the gratuity payment to an employee arises only on the completion of 5 years of continued service with the Company. The provision of the Company is not externally funded. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 38.1 Defined benefit plans - provision for employee benefits As at 31.12.2024 31.12.2023 Rs. Rs. Present value of unfunded obligation 94,123,807 68,709,878

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions employed with all other variables held constant in the employment liability measurement.

All other financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial liability is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest expense, are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Other non-derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Derecognition of other financial liabilities Other liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION AND FAIR VALUE Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction on the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either; • In the principal market for the asset or liability or ; • In the absence of the principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. When available, the Company measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. For units in unit trusts, fair value is determined by reference to published bid-values. If a market for a financial instrument is not active, then the Company establishes fair value using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties (if available), reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models. The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs, relies as little as possible on estimates specific to the Company, incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with. accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Inputs to valuation techniques reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk-return factors inherent in the financial instrument. The Company calibrates valuation techniques and tests them for validity using prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on other available observable market data.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 245 The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument i.e. without modification or re-packaging, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in the statement of profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. Any difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would be determined at that date using a valuation technique in a situation in which the valuation is dependent on unobservable is not recognised in the statement of profit or loss immediately, but is recognised over the life of the instrument on an appropriate basis or when the instrument is redeemed, transferred or sold, or the fair value becomes observable. Assets and long positions are measured at a bid price; liabilities and short positions are measured at an asking price. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Company and the counter party where appropriate. Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or model uncertainties; to the extent that the Company believes a third-party market participant would take them into accounting pricing a transaction.

The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish their fair values. The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique. • Level 1: Listed/quoted (adjusted) prices in active markets for identical instruments are available. The Company measures the fair value of a financial instrument using active listed/ quoted prices or dealer price quotations and managers buying price. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. • Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. This category includes instruments valued using; quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. • Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. Non-market observable input means that fair values are determined, in whole or in part, using a valuation technique (model) based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument, nor are they based on available market data.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 248 Financial instruments not carried at fair value The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair value in the financial statements. Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets/liabilities that have a short term maturity (less than three months), it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. The following table lists those financial instruments for which their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature. This assumption is also applied to savings accounts without a specific maturity. Assets Liabilities Cash in hand and balances at bank Bank overdraft Repurchase agreements Outstanding commission payable Fixed deposits with less than three months remaining maturity Amounts due to related parties Savings accounts Other liabilities Insurance receivables Reinsurance payables Reinsurance receivables Fixed deposits with more than three months remaining maturity The fair values are estimated based on discounted cash flows using rates currently available for similar instruments on similar term, credit risk and remaining maturities. Debentures The fair values of debentures are determined based on the last traded market price of the instrument published at the Colombo Stock Exchange. Staff loans Fair values are computed based on the interest rate that prevailed at reporting date. 45. RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK The Company is exposed to various types of risks in carrying out its business activities. Thus, the Company has implemented a proper system of risk and financial management framework to protect the Company from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of financial performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.

REPORT PROFILE FY 2024 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 252 Notes to the Financial Statements This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. b) Credit risk Assessment of credit risk is based on a variety of data by applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of financial assets. Each exposure is assessed at initial recognition based on available information about the financial assets. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade based on 3 stage model. The monitoring typically involves change in investment credit ratings of counter parties and instruments and number of days over due in terms of insurance and reinsurance receivables. c) Generating the term structure of probability of default (PD) Date past due has been taken as the primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for insurance receivables. The Company collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by customer segments. For investment portfolio, information gathered from external credit agencies is used (debt instruments). The Company employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generates estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and changes in key macroeconomic factors. Using variety of external actual and forecasted information, the Company formulates a base case view of the future direction of relevant economic variables (GDP growth and effect) as well as a representative range (best case and worst case) of other possible forecast scenarios. The Company then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs. d) Incorporation of forward-looking information The Company incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. Using variety of external actual and forecasted information, the Company formulates a base case view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range (best case and worst case) of other possible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each outcome. External information includes economic data and forecasts published by both local and international sources. The base case represents a most-likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the Company for other purposes such as strategic planning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes. Periodically, the Company carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of these other representative scenarios. e) Measurement of ECL The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables. These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data. They are adjusted to reflect forward- looking information as described above. Probability of default (PD) PD estimates are estimates at a certain date which are calculated based on statistical models and assessed using various categories based on homogenous characteristics of exposures. These statistical models are based on internally compiled data comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large corporate counterparties. Loss given default (LGD) LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive. Exposure at default (EAD) EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, and accrued interest from missed payments. f) Loss allowance The following tables show reconciliations from the opening to the closing balance of the loss allowance by class of financial instruments. Explanation of the terms: 12-month ECL, lifetime ECL and credit-impaired are included in 47.D.i. Reconciliation from the opening balance to closing balance of the gross carrying amounts by class of financial instrument The Company has not considered financial investments classified as FVTPL and FVOCI, since this class consists of risk- free government securities. Therefore, following note presents the reconciliation of financial investment at amortised cost. ECL movement of Insurance receivable disclosed in note 29.2

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 278 Effects on The Statement of Comprehensive Income Effects on the Statement of Financial Position Impact of the SLFRS 17 on the Financial Statements Financial Statement Caption Impact Area Impact Present seperately in the financial statements. A combination of • Liability for Remaining Coverage (LRC) for unexpired risk/future coverage; and • Liability of Incurred Claims (LIC) for past coverage.The discounted balances of LIC and the impact of unwinding as at each reporting date. Presented seperatly in the statement of financial possition. Currently, company reports reinsurnace receivable and payable seperately.But under the SLFRS 17 these balances will be netted off and presented in an asset possition. Company will be required to charge for the expected credit risk at the point of recognition of reinsurance receivables. Deferred acquisition costs will no longer appear as a separate assets line item on the balance sheet. Instead it will be incuded in the insurance contract liabilities.Reconciliation from the opening to closing balances of insurance acquisition cash flows (CFS) as a disclosure note will be included. Premium receivable will not be presented separately in the Statement of Financial Position.Instead the receivable balance will be netted off against the insurance contract liability. Include in the measurement of insurance contracts and disclose claims paid in a reconciliation from the opening to closing balances of insurance contracts. Company will adjust the carrying amount of the liability with the loss component in relation to onerous contracts. As a result liability for remaining coverage will be increased based on the loss component in relation to group of onerous contracts. Insurance Contract Liabilities Reinsurance Contract Assests Deferred acquisition costs Premiums receivable Claims payable Onerous contracts (Loss component) Insurance Revenue Onerous contracts Investment Components Directly attributable expenses Treatment for long term contracts Discounting of Incurred claims Reinsurance Contracts Insurance revenue is recognised based on the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to the period (excluding the investment components and adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk, if applicable). SLFRS 17 requires groups of insurance contracts to be assessed based on the likelihood of them being or becoming onerous at initial recognition Accordingly Company required to recognize onerous contracts at inception This would mean early losses will be recognized under the SLFRS 17 in statement of the Comprehensive Income. Company’s existing product portfolio do not contain either distinct or non distinct investment components.So, the company is not currently required to segregate the related income seperately. Company currenlty amortize acquisition expenses over the period of the contract. Under SLFRS 17,entity is permitted to charge directly attributable expenses up front to the profit and loss statement provided contracts are one year or less. This option will have a point of time impact to the financial statements of the entity however the impact is expected to be minimal over time. Considering the Company total product portfolio only two product is having a coverage period exceeding 12 months. These products make approximately 0.4% of the total revenue. So, the impact is immaterial. Company consider discounting the liability using a suitable discount rate for the claims that exceed one year. Then the interest expense in P&L will be determined using the locked in rate at the date the incurred claim is recognized. The contract boundary on reinsurance treaties may differ from underlying direct contracts Profits will not necessarily be released on a consistent basis between reinsurance and the direct contracts.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 279 Glossary of Insurance Terms A Accumulation The total combined risks that could be involved in a single loss event (involving one or more insured perils). Acquisition expenses Direct costs an insurer incurs to ‘acquire’ the premium such as commissions paid to a broker. These costs are required to be expensed in the same ratio as the premiums to which they relate are earned. The amount to be expensed in future periods recorded as deferred acquisition costs (an asset) in the statement of financial position. Actuary A specialist in the mathematics of insurance who calculates rates, reserves, dividends and other statistics. Administrative expenses Costs of an administrative nature including those arising from premium collection, portfolio administration and inward and outward reinsurance, including staff costs and depreciation provisions in respect of property, plant and equipment. Admissible assets Assets that may be included in determining an insurer’s statutory solvency position. Such assets are specified under the rules made by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka under the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 and subsequent amendments thereto. Agent An individual who is an independent contractor authorised to carry out transactions on behalf of another, such as the sale of insurance policies. Insurance agents usually earn commission or a fee on the sale of a policy. In Sri Lanka they are tied to a particular insurance company and offer a limited selection of products. All risks A property insurance which covers any accidental loss or damage that is not specifically excluded under the policy. Annual basis of accounting A basis of accounting for non-life insurance business whereby a result is determined at the end of the accounting period reflecting the profit or loss from providing insurance cover during that period and any adjustments to the profit or loss of providing insurance cover during earlier accounting periods. Automobile liability insurance Coverage for bodily injury and property damage incurred through ownership or operation of a vehicle. B Broker A firm that acts as an intermediary between a buyer and seller usually charging commission or a fee. Insurance brokers arrange cover on behalf of their clients and represent the interests of the policyholder. Burglary and theft Coverage for property taken or destroyed by breaking and entering the insured’s premises, burglary or theft, forgery or counterfeiting, fraud, kidnap and ransom and off-premises exposure. Bodily injury liability coverage Coverage for damages resulting in bodily injury or death sustained by others, including covered medical costs, that you become legally responsible for because of a covered auto accident. C Capital adequacy ratio A risk based Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) measures the relative adequacy of an insurer’s capital. The CAR value reports on the adequacy of the Total Available Capital (TAC) in insurance and shareholder’s funds collectively, to support the Risk based Capital Required (RCR). Captive agent An individual who sells or services insurance contracts for a specific insurer or fleet of insurers. Casualty insurance A form of liability insurance providing coverage for negligent acts and omissions such as workers compensation, errors and omissions, fidelity, crime, glass, boiler and various malpractices coverage. Cedent A ceding insurer. A ceding insurer is an insurer that underwrites and issues an original, primary policy to an insured and contractually transfers (cedes) a portion of the risk to a reinsurer. Cession A particular risk exposure that is transferred under a reinsurance treaty. Claim handling expenses (CHE) Expenses incurred while investigating and settling an insurance claim, over and above the cost of the claim itself. Can include legal and other professional fees. Also known as loss adjustment expenses. Claims incurred Claims incurred include paid claims and movements in outstanding claims. Claims notification clause A clause in an insurance or reinsurance contract which sets out the procedure that the insured or reassured must follow in order to make a claim under the contract Such clauses frequently provide for prompt notification of claims and events which may give to claims in the future. Claims outstanding The amount provided to cover the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims arising out of events which have occurred by the balance sheet date, including Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and claims handling expenses, less amounts already paid in respect of those claims. Co-insurance An arrangement whereby two or more insurers enter into a single contract with the insured to cover a risk in agreed proportions at a specified premium.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 280 Combined ratio The claims and expenses of an insurer for a given period divided by its net earned premium for the same period. It is normally expressed as a percentage with any figure in excess of 100%, signifying a technical underwriting loss. Commercial package policy A broad package of property and liability coverage for commercial ventures other than those provided insurance through a business owner’s policy. Cover note A document issued by an insurer/broker, pending the issue of a policy which confirms the arrangement of cover for the named insured/reassured. Motor insurance cover notes that are issued in Sri Lanka are usually of short duration. D Deductible Loss retention of the reinsured in non- proportional reinsurance. Limit above which the reinsurer becomes liable for losses up to the amount of the agreed cover limit. Deferred acquisition costs Under the annual basis of accounting, acquisition costs relating to the unexpired period of risk of contracts in force at the balance sheet date which are carried forward from one accounting period to subsequent accounting periods. E Earned premium The proportion of premium that relates to a used period of cover. Excess The amount or proportion of some or all losses arising under an insurance or reinsurance contract that is the insured or reassured must bear. If the loss is less than the amount of the excess then the insured/ reassured must meet the cost of it (unless there is other insurance in place to cover the excess). Excesses may either be compulsory or voluntary. An insured who accepts an increased excess in the form of a voluntary excess will usually receive a reduction in premium. Excess of loss A type of reinsurance that covers specified losses incurred by the reassured in excess of a stated amount (the excess) up to a higher amount. An excess of loss reinsurance is a form of non-proportional reinsurance. Exclusion A term in an insurance or reinsurance contract that excludes the insurer or reinsurer from liability for specified types of loss. An exclusion may apply throughout a policy or it may be limited to specific sections of it. In certain circumstances, an exclusion may be limited or removed altogether following the payment of an additional premium. Ex-gratia payment A payment made by underwriters ‘as a favour’ or ‘out of kindness’ without an admission of liability so as to maintain goodwill. F Facultative reinsurance Reinsurance for a single risk or a defined package of risks. The ceding company (the primary issuer) is not compelled to submit these risks to the reinsurer, but neither is the reinsurer compelled to provide reinsurance protection. G General average A loss that arises from the reasonable sacrifice at a time of peril of any part of a ship or its cargo for the purpose of preserving the ship and the remainder of its cargo together with any expenditure made for the same purpose. An example of a general average loss would include jettisoning cargo to keep a ship afloat and an example of general average expenditure would include towing a stricken vessel into port. An average adjuster calculates the value of each saved interest to each interested party which is then obliged to contribute towards the general average loss or expenditure proportionately. Subject to the terms of the policy, insurance will generally only apply if the loss was incurred to avoid or in connection with the avoidance of an insured peril. Gross written premium Original and additional inward premiums, plus any amount in respect of administration fees or policy expenses remitted with a premium but before the deduction of outward reinsurance premiums. I Incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses Estimated losses which an insurer or reinsurer, based on its knowledge or experience of underwriting similar contracts, believes have arisen or will arise under one or more contracts of insurance or reinsurance, but which have not been notified to an insurer or reinsurer at the time of their estimation. Indemnity The principle according to which a person who has suffered a loss is restored (so far as possible) to the same financial position that he was in immediately prior to the loss, subject in the case of insurance to any contractual limitation as to the amount payable (the loss may be greater than the policy limit). The application of this principle is called indemnification. Most contracts of insurance are contracts of indemnity. Life insurances and personal accident insurances are not contracts of indemnity as the payments due under those contracts for loss of life or bodily injury are not based on the principle of indemnity. Insurance contract A contract under which the insurer accepts significant insurance risk from the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if specified uncertain future events adversely affect the policyholder.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 281 Insurance provision Usually relates to the proportion of net written premiums relating to periods of risk after the accounting date, which are deferred to subsequent accounting periods, as well as the gross claims outstanding. Insurance risk Uncertainty over the likelihood of an insured event occurring, the quantum of the claim or the time when claims payments will fall due. L Layer Section of cover in a non-proportional reinsurance programme in which total coverage is divided into number of consecutive layers. Individual layers may be placed with different reinsurers. Liability adequacy test (LAT) A test that needs to be performed by an insurer to determine whether its recognized insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance contracts as per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. Loss adjuster A person who is appointed to investigate the circumstances of a claim under an insurance policy and to advice on the amount that is payable to the policyholder in order to settle that claim. Loss development factors (LDF) There is a general upward trend in claim totals after the initial reporting period called ‘loss development’. A common method of adjusting losses for the growth in claims and Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) losses is to apply loss development factors. N Net expense ratio Expenses associated with running an insurance business, such as commission, professional fees and other administrative costs, expressed as a percentage of net earned premiums. P Premium The payment a policyholder makes in return for insurance cover. Usually paid annually. Premium liability The amount required to be held in respect of the unexpired period of exposure and considers the unearned premium reserves held and estimate of unexpired risk reserves. Provision of risk margin for adverse deviation (PRAD) The provision of risk margin for adverse deviation that relates to the inherent uncertainty in the central estimate value of both the premium and claim liabilities at a 75% level of sufficiency. R Reinsurance A form of insurance bought by insurance companies to protect themselves from the risk of large losses. One insurer pays to place part of an insured risk or an entire book of business with one or more other insurance companies, known as the reinsurers. Reinsurance commission Commission received or receivable in respect of premiums paid or payable to a reinsurer. Reinsurance inwards The acceptance of risks under a contract of reinsurance. Reinsurance outwards The placing of risks under a contract of reinsurance. Reinsurance premium The premium payable to the reinsurer. Reinsurance is an arrangement whereby one party (the reinsurer), in consideration for a premium, agrees to indemnify another party (the cedent) against part or all of the liability assumed by the cedent under a policy or policies of insurance. Reinsurance profit commission Commission received or receivable by the cedent (reinsured) from the reinsurer based on the net profit (as defined in the treaty) made by the reinsurer on the reinsurance treaty. Related party A related party is a person or an entity that is related to the reporting entity: • A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person has control, joint control, or significant influence over the entity or is a member of its key management personnel. • An entity is related to a Reporting entity if, among other circumstances, it is a parent, subsidiary, fellow subsidiary, associate, or joint venture of the reporting entity, or it is controlled, jointly controlled, or significantly influenced or managed by a person who is a related party. Retention The amount of any loss or combination of losses that would otherwise be payable under an insurance/reinsurance contract which the insured/reassured must bear itself before the insurer or reinsurer becomes liable to make any payment under that contract. An insured or reassured may be able to insure its retention with another insurer/reinsurer. Risk based capital Capital to be allocated by a company to cover risks arising from the nature of its business and the markets in which it operates, based on an assessment of those risks and the likelihood of adverse developments. S Short-period cancellation When an insurance contract is terminated prior to its expiry date by the insured any return premium that is payable will usually be calculated on a time on risk basis. The result is that the insured will receive less return premium than would be the case if the return premium was calculated on a pro-rata basis.

People’s Insurance PLC | Annual Report 2024 282 Solvency margin The difference between the value of assets and value of liabilities, required to be maintained by the insurer who carries on general insurance business as defined in Solvency Margin (General Insurance) Rules, 2004 and subsequent amendments thereto made under section 26 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 and subsequent amendments thereto. Subrogation The right of an insurer which has paid a claim under a policy to step into the shoes of the insured so as to exercise in his name all lights he might have with regard to the recovery of the loss which was the subject of the relevant claim paid under the policy up to the amount of that paid claim. The insurer’s subrogation rights may be qualified in the policy. In the context of insurance, subrogation is a feature of the principle of indemnity and therefore only applies to contracts of indemnity so that it does not apply to life assurance or personal accident policies. It is intended to prevent an insured recovering more than the indemnity he receives under his insurance (where that represents the full amount of his loss) and enables his insurer to recover or reduce its loss. Sum insured The maximum amount that an insurer will pay under a contract of insurance. The expression is usually used in the context of property and life insurance where (subject to the premium cost) the insured determines the amount of cover to be purchased. Surplus treaty or surplus lines treaty A type of reinsurance under which bands of cover known as lines are granted above a given retention which is referred to as the cedant’s line. Each line is of equivalent size and the capacity of the treaty is expressed as a multiple of the cedant’s line. The reinsurer receives an equivalent proportion of the full risk premium. A surplus treaty is a form of proportional reinsurance. T Technical reserve This comprises the claims reserve net of reinsurance, unearned premium reserve net of reinsurance and the deferred acquisition expenses. Total available capital Measures the actual available capital held by an insurer eligible to calculate capital adequacy. Treaty reinsurance A reinsurance contract under which the reassured agrees to offer and the reinsurer agrees to accept all risks of certain size within a defined class. U Underinsurance Insurance where the sum insured is less than the full value at risk and would not be adequate to meet a total loss. Underwriting The process of selecting which risks an insurance company can cover and deciding the premiums and terms of acceptance. Underwriting profit The underwriting result generated by transacting non-life insurance business, without taking into account the investment income. Unearned premium The proportion of premium that relates to the unused period of cover. Unexpired risk reserve (URR) The excess of the estimated value of claims and expenses likely to arise after the end of the financial year from contracts concluded before the date, insofar as their estimated value exceeds the provision for unearned premiums (after deduction of any acquisition costs deferred).
