Step 4: Survey and Investigation (if applicable) A surveyor, Adjustor or investigator may visit the site (in case of property or marine claims) to assess the damage or loss. Provide access to the surveyor and offer them any necessary details. If itâ€™s a health claim, the we may require medical records or a hospital visit to verify treatment details. Why Itâ€™s Important: The loss adjuster helps us to assess the extent of the loss or damage, ensuring the correct settlement amount based on policy terms. Step 5: Claim Assessment The insurance company will review all the documents, reports, and surveyor findings. Wait for the evaluation of your claim, which could include an assessment of the repair costs, medical bills, or the financial loss. Why Itâ€™s Important: The insurer needs to verify the claimâ€™s legitimacy and calculate the compensation that aligns with your policy coverage. Step 6: Approval or Rejection Once the claim is processed, the insurer will communicate the approval or rejection of your claim. If the claim is approved, the insurer will provide details about the settlement amount and the next steps. If the claim is rejected, the insurer will provide reasons and may offer a chance to appeal or submit additional documents. Why Itâ€™s Important: Understanding the approval/rejection decision helps you understand if and how youâ€™ll be compensated. If rejected, knowing the reasons will help you to address any issues.
